# InfiCon 2019 React Native

This repository contains the slides and code for my talk @ InfiCon 2019.

Every coding step I demonstrated in my talk is tagged in the repository, so you can walk through the steps yourself.

## Running the app
Make sure to install the necessary requirements:
```
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

Start an emulator or connect a device set to debug-mode, e.g.:
```
~/Android/Sdk/emulator/emulator -avd <YOUR_EMULATOR_NAME>
```

And then from the "HelloInfiCon"-directory run:

```
react-native run-android
# or
react-native run-ios

```
